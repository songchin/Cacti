/*!
 *  The nft_popen() function forks a command in a child process, and returns
 *  a pipe that is connected to the child's standard input and output. It is
 *  like the standard popen() call, except that it returns the file descriptor,
 *  instead of a stdio stream created by fdopen(). The file descriptor can be
 *  used with select() or poll(), or the caller can use fdopen() if a stdio
 *  FILE* is preferable.
 *
 *  The mode argument is defined as in standard popen(). 
 *
 *  On success, returns a file descriptor, or -1 on error.
 *  On failure, returns -1, with errno set to one of:
 *	EINVAL  The mode argument is incorrect.
 *	EMFILE	pipe() failed.
 *	ENFILE  pipe() failed.
 *	ENOMEM  malloc() failed.
 *	EAGAIN  fork() failed.
