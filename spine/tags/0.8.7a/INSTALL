spine: a backend data gatherer for cacti
------------------------------------------

Below are some random notes about installing:

- to minimize the impact of MIB files for net-snmp, utilize the
  --disable-mib-loading configure option in net-snmp (vers 5.1 and above).
- right now spine requires -lmysqlclient_r to compile (which may be
  removed in the future). It seems that the default Redhat (at least
  RH9) RPM's have trouble with this. The mysql.com RPMs work fine
  though.
- you need to have all the correct headers and libtool as well.  Make
  sure you have a good development environment.
- Make sure to edit spine.conf
