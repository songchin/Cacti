Prerequisites

A working cygwin enviroment available @ www.cygwin.com
You will need at least GCC from the cygwin distrubution in order to compile spine.  I
that you build spine on a full development system and then transfer the binary to
a minimal build system to run.

You need to download the UNIX sources of NetSNMP and the MySQL.  Please do not download
the Windows versions of these source distributions.

MySQL source files available @ www.mysql.com/downloads
Net-SNMP source files available @ www.net-snmp.org/download
