------------------------------------------
spine: a backend data gatherer for cacti
------------------------------------------

This code represents high speed poller replacement for cmd.php.
It has come quite a ways from it's initial development.  It is 100% compatible
with the legacy cmd.php processor.

Make sure that you have a good development environment setup to compile spine.
This includes compilers, header files and things such as libtool.  If you have
questions, use the forums.
