spine: a backend data gatherer for cacti
------------------------------------------
Compile Requirements:
 
- net-snmp-devel
- mysql
- mysql-devel
- openssl-devel
 
Below are some random notes about installing:

- to minimize the impact of MIB files for net-snmp, utilize the
  --disable-mib-loading configure option in net-snmp (vers 5.1 and above).
  
- right now spine requires -lmysqlclient_r to compile (which may be
  removed in the future). It seems that the default Redhat (at least
  RH9) RPM's have trouble with this. The mysql.com RPMs work fine
  though.
  
- Be sure you have a good development environment including autoconf,
  automake and libtool.
 
- If ./configure fails with the error 'libtool.m4 and ltmain.sh have 
  a version mismatch!', run the following:
 
  aclocal
  libtoolize --force
  autoconf
  autoheader
  automake  

- Make sure to edit spine.conf
