Prerequisites:

A working cygwin enviroment available @ www.cygwin.com
You will need at least GCC from the cygwin distrubution in order to compile 
Spine.  I that you build spine on a full development system and then transfer
the binary to a minimal build system to run.

You need to download the UNIX sources of NetSNMP and the MySQL.  Please do not
download the Windows versions of these source distributions.

MySQL source files available @ www.mysql.com/downloads
Net-SNMP source files available @ www.net-snmp.org/download

Build Instructions:

MySQL:

Only the client libraries are needed for cactid so MySQL can be configured with
the following option:

./configure --without-server --enable-thread-safe-client

make
make install

NetSNMP:

Use the experimental reentrant configure flag.  Also, these options works 
with the 5.3++ net-snmp, but may not work with prior versions.  The big thing
to note when compiling net-snmp on Cygwin is to avoid all PERL related options
as perlmod's do not compile in windows in general.

./configure --enable-reentrant --disable-agent --disable-mibs \
  --with-perl-modules=no --disable-mib-loading --with-defaults

make
make install

Spine:

Nothing too special required. Run ./configure --help for assistance.

aclocal
libtoolize --force
autoheader
automake
autoconf
./configure [many options]

make
make install
