Prerequisites

A working cygwin enviroment available @ www.cygwin.com
You will need at least GCC from the cygwin distrubution in order to compile cactid

At the time of this writing the cygwin1.dll included with the distrubution was problematic, if you encounter problems with cactid you will want to replace it with the latest snapshot available @ http://cygwin.com/snapshots/

The UNIX sources of NetSNMP and the MySQL

MySQL source files available @ www.mysql.com/downloads
Net-SNMP source files available @ www.netsnmp.org/download

At the time of this writing netsnmp 5.1 would not compile with cygwin, 5.09 was used
