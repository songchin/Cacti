		Cacti is designed to be a complete graphing solution for your network. Its goal is to make the
		network administrator's job easier by taking care of all the necessary details necessary to create
		meaningful network graphs.

		<p>The design of Cacti took many hours of SQL and PHP coding, so I hope you find it very useful.</p>

		<p><strong>Developer Thanks</strong><br>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li><a href="http://blyler.cc">Andy Blyler</a>, for ideas, code, and that much needed overall support
			during really lengthy coding sessions.</li>
			<li>Rivo Nurges, for that c-based poller that was talked so long about. This <em>really</em> fast poller
			is what will enable Cacti to make its way into larger and larger networks.</li>
			<li>Larry Adams, for providing insight, time, superb support, and personal sanity. I could not have pulled
			off a release of this magnitude without your help.
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p><strong>Thanks</a></strong><br>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>A very special thanks to <a href="http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/">Tobi Oetiker</a>,
				the creator of <a href="http://www.mrtg.org/">RRDTool</a> and the very popular
				<a href="http://www.mrtg.org">MRTG</a>.</li>
			<li>Brady Alleman, creator of NetMRG and
				<a href="http://www.thtech.net">Treehouse Technolgies</a> for questions and ideas. Just
				as a note, NetMRG is a complete Network Monitoring solution also written in PHP/MySQL. His
				product also makes use of RRDTool's graphing capabilities, I encourage you to check it out.</li>
			<li>The users of Cacti! Especially anyone who has taken the time to create a bug report, or otherwise
				help me fix a Cacti-related problem. Also to anyone who has purchased an item from my amazon.com
				wishlist or donated money via Paypal.</li>
