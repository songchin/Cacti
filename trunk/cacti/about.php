			raXnet's cacti is designed to be the complete frontend to rrdtool. Cacti's goal is to make the
			network administrator's job easier by taking care of all the nessesary details to create 
			meaningful network graphs.
			
			<p>The design of cacti took many hours of SQL and PHP coding, so I hope you find it very useful.</p>
