<h2>Cacti Coding Standards</h2><p>

<h3>Cacti-Specific Stuff</h3><p>

<ul>
	<li>Don't use variables such as $HTTP_SERVER_VARS["SCRIPT_NAME"] to describe the current file. Write
	out the complete filename when referencing to the file. (ex. rra.php)</li>
	<li>Try to store all calls to colors in the $colors array (stored in include/config_vars.php)</li>
	<li>Try to consalidate files whenever possible. For instance, all of the CDEF stuff is stored in
	cdef.php. In 0.6.x this was split into two separate files: cdef.php and cdef_items.php. This
	guidline does not apply as much to files in the 'include/' directory.</li>
	<li>Use to $args and $form arrays to reference to HTTP GET/POST variables repectively. Do not use PHP's
	$_GET and $_POST arrays, since they require PHP 4.1.0 or higher.</li>
	<li>When saving data from a form, try to always use the sql_save() function.</li>
	<li>Always use the start_box() and end_box() functions to start/stop HTML "boxes".</li>
	<li>When rendering the actual form try and use as much HTML as possible, using PHP where needed. This
	differs from 0.6.x where the entire form was generated using functions. Many of those functions
	are still used, however more HTML means the ability to generate more "custom looking" forms. Look
	cdef.php for a good example of how to moderate this.</li>
	<li>Use db_fetch_cell() when your expecting one value from one column back. Use db_fetch_row() when
	you are expecting one whole row back. Use db_fetch_assoc() when you are expecting multiple rows 
	back from the SQL query, use the syntax 'foreach ($output as $item)' to loop through the output.
	Always make sure to check if you got any output before trying to loop through it, or you will
	receive an error.</li>
	<li>Update the 'dev/sql/changes.sql' file with any database schema changes you make.</li>
	<li>Feel free to keep your complete database schema in 'dev/sql/complete_db-name'.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Sense Stuff</h3><p>

<ul>
	<li>When in doubt... indent! (loops, if/case/function statements, etc)</li>
	<li>Comment where ever possible, there is no such thing as too many comments. Use the c-style /* */ 
	for comments.</li>
	<li>Your code should look clean. Make sure to space things out appropriatly and not run lots of lines
	together one one line.</li>
	<li>Use descriptive variables that show what the variable is for. $i is generally the only exception
	to this rule.</li>
	<li>If you are storing an "old variable" (previous value), name it like: $_graph_type_name, the current
	version would be named: $graph_type_name</li>
	<li>Only select the columns you need in your SQL select statements.</li>
	<li>Use the print() function, not the echo() function.</li>
	<li>Use print() when displaying small portions of HTML (1 or 2 lines), break out of PHP (?&gt; &lt;?)
	when displaying a bunch of HTML at once.</li>
</ul>
