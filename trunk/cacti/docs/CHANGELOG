value, --unit, and --logarithmic.
-feature: Added the ability to show exact numbers in GPRINT, users can now 
specify a custom GPRINT string on a per-graph item basis.
-bug: Any data input source with more than one output would be added as a 
multi-data source .rrd file.
-bug: Some data source file name issues.
-bug: Cacti now checks to see if a host exists when adding it to be graphed.
-feature: There is now an optional "remove verification" for most of

-bug: Fixed some rare HTML "multipart/form" bugs with PHP.
-feature: Added a "Default View Mode" for each user when viewing graphs.
-bug: Fixed some bugs where you would change a parent graph item to a child 
or a child graph item to a parent when graph grouping was turned on.
-bug: Fixed some potential security bugs by eliminating cacti's use of

0.6.7
-feature: Added a "none" option for a data source when creating a CDEF.
This can be used if you check the "Use the current data source being 
used on the graph instead of a preset one" box.
-feature: Each user has a default graph policy: ALLOW or DENY for their
graph permissions.
-bug: Unique .rrd filename/data source name issues for SNMP "Make Graph"
have been fixed.
-feature: Changing the data source for a graph group parent will change
the data sources for each of the child items.
-bug: Logging has been fixed so errors do not show up in the Apache 
error_log any more.
-bug: VRULE's work correctly now. Enter a time in the "value" field to use
them, such as "00:00" or "14:00".
-feature: If you select a graph to be added to the graph hierarchy, the
"This Item is a Graph" checkbox is automatically selected.
-docs: Install docs have been updated for Unix/Win32, documentation on 
upgrading cacti has been added. See the 'docs/' directory for more 
information.
-bug: SNMP can function on win32/unix without snmpwalk/snmpget binaries.
This will only work if you have php-snmp support compiled into both your
php binary and web server modules. This is already the case for win32.
-bug: A bug when more than one data source was created using the same
data input source with multiple outputs has been fixed.
-feature: The default install/upgrade screen has been revised.

0.6.6
-feature: Multiple data sources per .rrd is supported. To use this
feature, simply create a data input source with multiple outputs that
'Update RRA'.
-feature: Graph item grouping, which enables you to delete/reorder
groups of similair graph items.
-feature: Graph preview and output preview in the console, which allows
you to preview what a graph will look like/what rrdtool's output is.
-feature: Graph-based permissions have added, you can also show/hide
certain hierarchies per user.
-feature: Multiple data source per .rrd file support, read the docs
for more information.
-feature: You can now export graphs to static png's/html's every n 
times.
-feature: By default, SNMP data source names come from <IP>_<IFNUM>,
instead of just <IFDESC> which is more unique.
-feature: More options for users such as where to go when the user logs
in and whether the user can have their own settings or not.

0.6.5
-bug: Fixed some of the data source naming issues. You can now 
use any data source name you want; cacti will take care of making
the name "rrdtool friendly".
-feature: Cacti will use PHP's builtin SNMP support if detected,
SNMP is overall faster now too. NOTE: PHP's SNMP support may not
work with all of your MIB names, you may have to use the OID 
instead!
-feature: Basic high speed counter support has been added, use
'hcin'/'hcout' to use it. Also may not work with PHP's builtin SNMP 
support yet.
-bug: Using the MAX consolidation function with graph data works 
better now. You can make graphs that look like the MRTG ones (5
minute maximum). This code still needs a little work though.

0.6.4
-bug: You can now add the same CDEF to multiple data sources in the
same graph.
-feature: Ability to "sync" changes with the .rrd file with rrdtool's
TUNE function. Cacti also tries to fill in internal data source path
and name information to keep graphs from "breaking" when possible.
-settings: You can now change the PHP Binary path from within cacti.
-feature: Cacti can now export static images/html files when it gathers
data like MRTG did.
-feature: Multiple graph hierarchies are supported.
-feature: You can now "zoom in" on any portion of the graph hierarchy
by clicking on a header item.
-bug: Some changes were made to make cacti more win32 complaint; a tutorial
on how to setup cacti on win32 can be found on the raXnet page.
-feature: You can now create all graphs for an SNMP host with one click.
-feature: You can customize the graph title when creating graphs using
the 'Make Graph' or 'Make All Graphs' link.
-feature: Data sources in cacti are no longer limited to 19 characters.
If you create a data source name that rrdtool will not like, cacti will
automatically modify the name and save it internally for rrdtool-only use.

0.6.3
-feature: Put limits (HTML 'maxlength') on fields that have a
maximum length.
-feature: Added 'cacti Settings' and 'User Administration' to the
cacti menu.
-feature: Added a 'Step' field for Data Sources to graph data at
non-300 second intervals.
-feature: Added a '--rigid' on/off option, plus the ability to choose
between '--alt-autoscale' and '--alt-autoscale-max' when using
auto scale.
-feature: Added a 'Base Value' field to the graphs to adjust how the
vertical axis is displayed.
-feature: Updated the menu/header graphics for a smoother look and
easier navigation.
-feature: cacti now stores its settings in the database instead of 
config.php, so they can be manipulated under 'cacti Settings'. 
Database credentials are still located in config.php however.
-feature: Added a preview of the rrdtool source when creating data 
sources.
-feature: Added a "data source duplicate" function and moved "graph
duplicate" to "Graphs" on the cacti menu.
-settings: You can now turn on/off cacti's builtin authentication.
-settings: You can control what is logged (create, graph, snmp, update).
-feature: Added a "Total All Data Sources" CDEF, which can be used
to represent the total of all of the data on a graph.
-bug: Fixed a few add/edit/delete form-related bugs.
-docs: Added some more content to the documentation and made it more
visible from within cacti.

0.6.2
-bug: Fixed some bugs when creating CDEF's using multiple
data sources.
-bug: Fixed more SNMP parsing bugs with some versions
of net-snmp.
-feature: added an "auto-refresh" feature to the graphs (thanks Nossie).
-bug: HRULE's and VRULE's acually work now.
-docs: the beginnings of some real documentation.
-bug: you can select the color black now.

0.6.1
-bug: Fixed a parsing bug with snmp, more parsing is done
in cacti's code and not via arguments passed to 
snmpget.
-auth: Updated the function used to hash passwords 
(more compatible with older MySQL versions), more 
strict on document caching.
-feature: Easier installation: cacti now checks for common
problems and gives suggestions. Database updates are
also done at this time.
-bug: Fixed a problem with adding new data input sources.
-bug: Problem saving the wrong numbers for 'Round Robin
Archives'.
-feature: Ability to preview the output of the cron script
from a web browser under 'Cron Printout'.
-feature: Added 'Logout User' to the menu.
