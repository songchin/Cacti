  Cacti's export function was buggy in cacti 0.8.5a, and lacked extra functionality.
  The patches presented here allow extra graph export options.

  Changes since Cacti 0.8.5a

  Cacti Settings has now a new tab (called Export) where you can choose when to export
  the graphs (Export timing). Options are:

    * Disable - there will be no graph export
    * Classic - export every x times - the default in cacti 0.8.5a
    * Hourly at specified minutes - every hour at xx minutes past the hour (eg: 35)
    * Daily at specified time - every day at the specified time (eg: 23:55)

  The second new option is Export method:

    * Classic - graph exporting will be done localy, on the host computer
    * FTP using the PHP built-in funtions - only available to users that built PHP with FTP support
    * FTP using the ncftpput client - for users which don't want to use PHP's built-in FTP support, and have the ncftpput binary installed.

  Bonsai is very similar to Cactistoric developed by Bruno Prigent, with a little bit
  more user friendly interface in mind (my opinion).

  Select in the graph (with your mouse) an area you are interested in. It's magic...
  the selected time period is displayed in a new graph, and with the left mouse
  button zoom out to view a larger time period.

  You can also add the displayed graph to your favorites in your browser.

  Added 3 new CDEF special types:

  Type  Description
  ----  -----------
   3    Total staggered datasources.
   4    Average all datasources.
   5    Average staggered datasources.

  Staggered datasources are determined by parsing graph item value
  column in the following manner:

  start=<starting position in datasource>&skip=<skip count>
