  Recently I needed the 95% line in a graph.  We'll be going to a "burstable" circuit soon
  and the provider will be billing based on the 95% usage.  I'm graphing both the input and
  the output rates on the same graph.  If I use "total" for the 95% line, the line is the sum
  of the two 95% rates, which is not what I expected.

  What I think I want is the maximum of the two 95% rates.  I tried "max", but that has to be
  tied to a particular input.  "max" is the 95% of all the peak values for the sample period
  for one data input.

  I've modified graph_variables.php and rrd.php to allow different types of 95% aggregations:

    current           current field of one data source
    total             sum of all 95% values for all data sources
    max               peak field of one data source
    total_peak        sum of all 95% peak values for all data sources
    all_max_current   maximum 95% value over all data sources
    all_max_peak      maximum 95% peak value over all data sources

  I made some cumulative Gigabyte graphs and noticed the 'sum' function multiplies the sum by
  the Data Source step - which is great for interpolating a continuous function, but does not
  add up single atomic values accurately.

  I coded the following to add another option to the sum function. A tag like so will now sum
  all the data points in a graph and provide a total of each, discrete point without
  interpolation.

2004-08-23: moonman [nitzan_tz@co.zahav.net.il] based on patch by SR [sbalukoff@cardomain.com]
  The attached patch against cacti 0.8.5a adds the 'SIMILAR_DATA_SOURCES_NODUPS' special
  data souce as a possible CDEF input for graph template items. This makes it possible to
  graph several different types of data on the same graph (eg. traffic_in and traffic_out),
  and have totals for each type of data without having to write one-shot CDEFs to handle each
  and every total. This really speeds up the generation of aggregate graphs where more than
  one data type is being graphed. (Check out the attached graph to see what I mean.)

  To use:

    1. Define a CDEF that uses the SIMILAR_DATA_SOURCES_NODUPS special data source.
    2. Create a graph template with a couple data sources of similar type (and associated
       graph template items.)
    3. Create a graph template item with the above CDEF, and with the same data source type
       as above and it will be the sum of the above.
    4. Add any different data source type you want and it won't affect the above sum.

  (And yes, you can interchange steps 3 and 4 above.)

  Cacti's export function was buggy in cacti 0.8.5a, and lacked extra functionality.
  The patches presented here allow extra graph export options.

  Changes since Cacti 0.8.5a

  Cacti Settings has now a new tab (called Export) where you can choose when to export
  the graphs (Export timing). Options are:

    * Disable - there will be no graph export
    * Classic - export every x times - the default in cacti 0.8.5a
    * Hourly at specified minutes - every hour at xx minutes past the hour (eg: 35)
    * Daily at specified time - every day at the specified time (eg: 23:55)

  The second new option is Export method:

    * Classic - graph exporting will be done localy, on the host computer
    * FTP using the PHP built-in funtions - only available to users that built PHP with FTP support
    * FTP using the ncftpput client - for users which don't want to use PHP's built-in FTP support,
      and have the ncftpput binary installed.

  Bonsai is very similar to Cactistoric developed by Bruno Prigent, with a little bit
  more user friendly interface in mind (my opinion).

  Select in the graph (with your mouse) an area you are interested in. It's magic...
  the selected time period is displayed in a new graph, and with the left mouse
  button zoom out to view a larger time period.

  You can also add the displayed graph to your favorites in your browser.

  Added 3 new CDEF special types:

  Type  Description
  ----  -----------
   3    Total staggered datasources.
   4    Average all datasources.
   5    Average staggered datasources.

  Staggered datasources are determined by parsing graph item value
  column in the following manner:

  start=<starting position in datasource>&skip=<skip count>

  Added additional screen help text to support value expanded usage.
