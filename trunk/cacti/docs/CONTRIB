  Bonsai is very similar to Cactistoric developed by Bruno Prigent, with a little bit 
  more user friendly interface in mind (my opinion).

  Select in the graph (with your mouse) an area you are interested in. It's magic... 
  the selected time period is displayed in a new graph, and with the left mouse 
  button zoom out to view a larger time period. 

  You can also add the displayed graph to your favorites in your browser.

  Added 3 new CDEF special types: 

  Type  Description
  ----  ----------- 
   3    Total staggered datasources.
   4    Average all datasources.
   5    Average staggered datasources.

  Staggered datasources are determined by parsing graph item value
  column in the following manner:

  start=<starting position in datasource>&skip=<skip count>
