Lossless Reindexing Patch for Cacti 0.8.7e
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This patch allows for a 66% increase in reindex performance and also
does reindexing a lossless manner.  It is important for large sites
with numerous indexed values.  It works optimally with SNMP v2 devices
but will also work well with other classes of devices.

This patch is made available for 0.8.7, but not in the mainline code.
It is already incorporated into the 0.8.8 core.

Installation:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
There are essentially two steps to installing this patch.  The first
is to apply the database changes in the install directory.  You can
do this by running the following command:

mysql cacti < install.sql

The second step is to choose your fileset to use.  It will either be
the PIA version or the Non-PIA version of Cacti.  You will simply 
copy the appropriate files over your existing files.

Notes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This patch is designed for 0.8.7e of Cacti and no other release.
It is also only compatible with only PIA 2.5.
There are no User Interface changes with this patch.  It's all
plumbing.
