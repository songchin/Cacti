MultiThreaded Host Patch for Cacti 0.8.7e
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This patch add the following functionality to Cacti.  First it adds
a field to Cacti that allows each host to be polled with from one
to many threads.  Second, it provides the ability for spine to
leverage that value and poll the host directly using the number of
threads specified.

This patch does not work with cmd.php.  It is only designed to work
with the Spine poller.

Caution is advised on using this patch with SNMP devices.  You have
been warned.

Installation:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three components to this change.  The first is the database
change.  This is accomplised by running the command below.  It will
modify the host table structure in Cacti.

mysql cacti < install.sql

The second step is to apply the patch below to the Cacti web site.
The patch will modify the following files:

cli/add_device.php
include/global_arrays.php
include/global_form.php
lib/api_device.php
host.php

There is no way to specify the hosts threads from the Cacti CLI.
The default will always be 1 thread per host.

The third component of this change is to patch install the latest
version of Spine 0.8.7f which exposes the capability to perform
this type of polling.

Notes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This patch is designed for 0.8.7e version of Cacti and no 
other releases.  Please keep this in mind before you try.  Also
it's always a good idea to make a backup and test in your test
environment first.  If you don't have one of those, get one.

This patch "might" work with other versions of Cacti.  However,
you may have to hand edit or apply the patches.

Also, please note, if you have installed other "custom" patches
you must closely evaluate those patches as they have not been
tested together and modify some of the same files.  So,
please be cautious.
