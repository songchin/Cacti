 *
 * This is a thread-safe variant of popen that does unbuffered IO, to
 * avoid running afoul of Solaris's inability to fdopen when fd > 255.

 *  nft_popen
 *

 *  file descriptor in order to return a stdio FILE *. This is useful if you
 *  wish to use select()- or poll()-driven IO.
 *
 *  The mode argument is defined as in standard popen(). 
 *
 *  On success, returns a file descriptor, or -1 on error.
 *  On failure, returns -1, with errno set to one of:
 *	EINVAL  The mode argument is incorrect.
 *	EMFILE	pipe() failed.
 *	ENFILE  pipe() failed.
 *	ENOMEM  malloc() failed.
 *	EAGAIN  fork() failed.
