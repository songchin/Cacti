		<sect1 id="Data_Retrieval">
		<title>Data Retrieval</title>
			<para>
				First task is to retrieve data. Cacti will do so using its Poller.
				The Poller is executed from the operating system's scheduler,
				e.g. crontab for Unix flavored OSes.
			</para>
			<para>
				In current IT installations, you're dealing with lots of devices
				of different kind, e.g. servers, network equipment, appliances
				and the like. To retrieve data from remote targets/hosts,
				cacti will mainly use the Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP.
				Thus, all devices capable of using SNMP will be eligible to be
				monitored by cacti.
			</para>
			<para>
				Later on, we demonstrate how to extend cacti's capabilities of
				retrieving data to scripts, script queries and more.
			</para>
		</sect1>
		<sect1 id="Data_Storage">
		<title>Data Storage</title>
			<para>
				There are lots of different approaches for this task. Some may
				use an (SQL) database, others flat files. Cacti uses <ulink url="http://www.rrdtool.org/"><application>RRDTool</application>
				</ulink> to store data.
			</para>
			<para>
				RRD is the acronym for Round Robin Database.
				RRD is a system to store and display time-series data
				(i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature, server load average).
				It stores the data in a very compact way that will not expand
				over time, and it can create beautiful graphs.
				This keeps storage requirements at bay.
			</para>
			<para>
				Likewise, rrdtool will perform some specific tasks.
				It performs consolidation to combine raw data (a primary data point in rrdtool lingo)
				to consolidated data (a consolidated data point). This way, historical data
				is compressed to save space. rrdtool knows different consolidation functions:
				AVERAGE, MAXIMUM, MINIMUM and LAST.
			</para>
		</sect1>
		<sect1 id="Data_Presentation">
		<title>Data Presentation</title>
			<para>
				One of the most appreciated features of <ulink url="http://www.rrdtool.org/"><application>RRDTool</application>
				</ulink> is the built-in
				graphing function. This comes in useful when combining this with
				some commonly used webserver. Such, it is possible to access
				the graphs from merely any browser on any plattform.
			</para>
			<para>
				Graphing can be done in very different ways. It is possible,
				to graph one or many items in one graph. Autoscaling is supported
				and logarithmic y-axis as well. You may stack items onto another
				and print pretty legends denoting characteristics such as
				minimum, average, maximum and lots more.
			</para>
		</sect1>
	</chapter>
	<chapter id="graph_overview">
		<title>Graph Overview</title>
		<para>
			Almost everything in Cacti is somehow related to a graph. At any time, you can list all available
			graphs by clicking on the <guilabel>Graph Management</guilabel> menu item. While it is possible to
			manually create graphs through this screen, new users should follow the instructions provided in the
			next chapter for creating new graphs in Cacti.
		</para>
		<para>
			For users that are familiar with <ulink url="http://www.rrdtool.org/"><application>RRDTool</application>
			</ulink>, you will immediately recognize that a graph in Cacti is closely modeled after <application>RRDTool</application>'s graphs.
			This makes sense since Cacti provides a user friendly interface to <application>RRDTool</application> without requiring users to
			understand how <application>RRDTool</application> works. With this in mind, every graph in Cacti has certain settings and at least
			one graph item associated with it. While graph settings define the overall properties of a graph, the graph
			items define the data that is to be represented on the graph. So the graph items define which data to display
			and how it should displayed, and also define what should be displayed on the legend.
		</para>
		<para>
			Each graph and graph item has a set of parameters which control various aspects of the graph.
			Fortunately through the use of graph templates, it is not necessary to understand the function
			of each field to create graphs for your network. When you are ready to take on the task of
			creating your own graph templates, extensive field descriptions for both graphs and graph items
			are provided in that section of the manual.
		</para>

		<title>How to Graph Your Network</title>
		<para>
			At this point, you probably realize that graphing is Cacti's greatest strength. Cacti has many powerful
			features that provide complex graphing and data acquisition, some which have a slight learning curve.
			Do not let that stop you however, because graphing your network is incredibly simple.
		</para>
		<para>
			The next two sections will outline the two basic steps which are typically required to create graphs for
			most devices.
		</para>
		<sect1 id="new_device">
			<title>Creating a Device</title>
			<para>
				The first step to creating graphs for your network is adding a device for each network device that
				you want to create graphs for. A device specifies important details such as the network
				hostname, SNMP parameters, and host type.
			</para>
			<para>
				To manage devices within Cacti, click on the <guilabel>Devices</guilabel> menu item.
				Clicking <guilabel>Add</guilabel>  will bring up a new device form. The first two fields,
				<guilabel>Description</guilabel> and <guilabel>Hostname</guilabel> are the only two fields that
				require your input beyond the defaults. If your host type is defined under the host template
				dropdown, be sure to select it here. You can always choose "Generic SNMP-enabled Host" if you are
				just graphing traffic or "None" if you are unsure. It is important to remember that the host
				template you choose will not lock you into any particular configuration, it will just provide
				more intelligent defaults for that type of host.

			<title>SNMP V3 Options Explained</title>
				<para>SNMP supports authentication and encryption features
				when using SNMP protocol version 3 known as
				<emphasis>View-Based Access Control Model (VACM)</emphasis>.
				This requires, that the
				target device in question supports and is configured for
				SNMP V3 use. In general, configuration of V3 options is
				target type dependant. The following is cited from
				<userinput>man snmpd.conf</userinput> concerning user definitions</para>
				<para><screen><citation>   <emphasis>SNMPv3 Users</emphasis>
       createUser [-e ENGINEID] username (MD5|SHA) authpassphrase [DES|AES] [privpassphrase]

              MD5 and SHA are the authentication types to use.  DES and AES are the privacy
              protocols  to  use. If  the  privacy  passphrase  is not specified, it is assumed
              to be the same as the authentication passphrase.  Note that the users created will
              be useless unless they are also added  to  the  VACM access control tables
              described above.

              SHA  authentication  and DES/AES privacy require OpenSSL to be installed and the
              agent to be built with OpenSSL support.  MD5 authentication may be used without
              OpenSSL.

              Warning: the minimum pass phrase length is 8 characters.</citation></screen></para>
				<para>VACM directives are explained from
				<userinput>man snmpd.conf</userinput> as follows</para>
				<para><screen><citation>   <emphasis>VACM Configuration</emphasis>
       The full flexibility of the VACM is available using four configuration directives -
       com2sec, group,  view and access.  These provide direct configuration of the underlying
       VACM tables.

       com2sec  [-Cn CONTEXT] SECNAME SOURCE COMMUNITY
              map  an  SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c community string to a security name - either from a
              particular range of source addresses, or globally ("default").  A restricted
              source can either be a specific  hostname (or  address),  or  a  subnet -
              represented as IP/MASK (e.g. 10.10.10.0/255.255.255.0), or IP/BITS
              (e.g. 10.10.10.0/24), or the IPv6 equivalents.

              The same community string can be specified in several separate directives
              (presumably with different  source  tokens), and the first source/community
              combination that matches the incoming request will be selected.  Various
              source/community combinations can also map to the same security name.

              If a CONTEXT is specified (using -Cn), the community string will be mapped
              to a security  name  in the named SNMPv3 context. Otherwise the default
              context ("") will be used.

       group GROUP {v1|v2c|usm} SECNAME
              maps  a  security name (in the specified security model) into a named group.
              Several group directives can specify the same group name, allowing a single
              access setting to apply to several  users and/or community strings.

              Note  that  groups must be set up for the two community-based models separately -
              a single com2sec (or equivalent) directive will typically be accompanied by two
              group directives.

       view VNAME TYPE OID [MASK]
              defines a named "view" - a subset of the overall OID tree. This is most commonly
              a single subtree, but  several view directives can be given with the same view
              name, to build up a more complex collection of OIDs.  TYPE is either included
              or excluded, which can again define a more complex view (e.g by excluding certain
              sensitive objects from an otherwise accessible subtree).

              MASK is a list of hex octets (separated by <quote>.</quote> or <quote>:</quote>)
              with the set bits indicating which subidentifiers in the view OID to match against.
              This can be used to define a view covering a particular row  (or  rows) in a table.
              If not specified, this defaults to matching the OID exactly (all bits set), thus
              defining a simple OID subtree.

       access GROUP CONTEXT {any|v1|v2c|usm} LEVEL PREFX READ WRITE NOTIFY
              maps from a group of users/communities (with a particular security model
              and  minimum  security level, and in a specific context) to one of three views,
              depending on the request being processed.

              LEVEL is one of noauth, auth, or priv.  PREFX specifies how CONTEXT should be
              matched against  the context  of  the  incoming  request, either exact or prefix.
              READ, WRITE and NOTIFY specifies the view to be used for GET*, SET and
              TRAP/INFORM requests (althought the NOTIFY view is not currently used).  For
              v1 or v2c access, LEVEL will need to be noauth.</citation></screen></para>

			In addition to giving you the tools to create sophisticated graphs, Cacti enables you to create users
			that are tailored specifically to their requirements. Each user has certain settings such as login
			actions, as well as graph viewing settings. There are also two levels of permissions control, realm
			permissions and graph permissions which enable you to control what the user can see and change.

		<para>
			Out of the box, there are two users that come with every Cacti installation. The "admin" user, is the
			main user that by default has access to see and change everything in Cacti. This is the user that you
			first login with in Cacti, and is probably a good idea to keep around unless you know otherwise. The
			second user is the "guest" user, which controls which areas/graphs are allowed for unauthenticated
			users. By default this user only has rights to view, but not change all graphs. This enables any
			unauthenticated user to visit 'graph_view.php' and view your graphs. This behavior can be changed by
			either changing the realm permissions for the "guest" user, or disabling the guest user altogether
			under <guilabel>Cacti Settings</guilabel>.  By default in 0.8.7 and later, the "guest" user is not
			set in the setting, effectively disabling "guest" (Unauthenticated) access to Cacti.

				<para>
					Realm permissions control which areas of Cacti a user can access. You can edit a user's realm
					permissions by selecting <guilabel>User Management</guilabel> and choosing the user you
					want to edit the permissions for. The <guilabel>Realm Permissions</guilabel> box will be displayed
					in the lower part of the screen. Each "realm" is a grouping that represents common tasks in Cacti,
					making it easier to fine tune each user's access.
				</para>
				<para>
					If you want to create a user that can only view graphs, you should select the <guilabel>View
					Graphs</guilabel> realm and leave everything else unchecked. See the <guilabel>Graph
					Permissions</guilabel> section for more information about how to fine tune this even more on a per-graph
					basis. Conversely, if the user needs to access the console, they will need <guilabel>Console
					Access</guilabel> and any additional realms that you see fit.

			<sect2 id="graph_permissions">
				<title>Graph Permissions</title>
				<para>
					Graph permissions control which graphs a user is allowed to view, it does not apply to editing graphs.
					You can edit a user's graph permissions by selecting <guilabel>User Management</guilabel> and choosing
					the user you want to edit the permissions for. Now select the <guilabel>Graph Permissions</guilabel> tab
					to view this user's graph permissions. There are three different ways that you can apply graph permissions,
					by graph, by host, or by graph template. This works by allowing or denying the user to all graphs associated
					with the particular group. So you can deny a user to a single graph, all graphs associated with a particular
					host, or all graphs associated with a particular graph template. Combining these three types of assigning
					graph permissions results in a very powerful graph policy editor.
				</para>
				<para>
					Each assignment type contains a <guilabel>Default Policy</guilabel> dropdown which can be used to control
					whether the user should be allowed to view everything or be denied from everything by default in the particular
					group. It is very important to remember that these policies are evaluated in the order: graph, host, graph
					template. Therefore, if you set graph's default policy to <guilabel>Deny</guilabel>, but kept host and graph
					template at <guilabel>Allow</guilabel>, the user's effective policy would be <guilabel>Deny</guilabel> since
					the graph assignment type is evaluated first. You typically either want to set all default policies to
					<guilabel>Deny</guilabel> for a restrictive user, or <guilabel>Allow</guilabel> for a non-restrictive user.
					If you thoroughly understand Cacti's graph permissions system, these default policies can be combined to provide
					very complex results.

			<sect2 id="graph_settings">
				<title>Graph Settings</title>
				<para>
					Cacti stores certain graph viewing settings for each user, which enables each user to view graphs in an optimal
					way. These preferences controls things such as the preview graph size or the default graph viewing mode to use.
					In addition to managing these settings here under user management, each user can change their own settings by
					clicking on the <guilabel>Graphs</guilabel> tab and selecting the <guilabel>Settings</guilabel> tab on the
					following page. If you want to prevent a user from being able to keep their own graph preferences, uncheck the
					<guilabel>Allow this User to Keep Custom Graph Settings</guilabel> checkbox in user management. The user will be
					presented with an "Access Denied" error message if they attempt to click the <guilabel>Settings</guilabel> tab
