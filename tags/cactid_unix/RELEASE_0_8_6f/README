cactid: a backend data gatherer for cacti
------------------------------------------

This code represents the future replacement for cmd.php.  It has come quite a 
ways from it's initial development.  It is almost 100% compatible with the 
legacy cmd.php processor.  The major drawback of the current implementation
is that it will only support the default snmp port of the host.  If you are
polling a device that has multiple agents on multiple ports, Cactid will
not work for you yet.
