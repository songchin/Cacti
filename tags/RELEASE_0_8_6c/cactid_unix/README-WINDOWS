Prerequisites

A working cygwin enviroment available @ www.cygwin.com
You will need at least GCC from the cygwin distrubution in order to compile cactid

At the time of this revised writing, CACTID is not stable in Windows when calling PHP scripts.  If you only
use native SNMP, you should be able to run error free.  It has also been reported that PERL runs as well.  
This stability issue continues to be researched.

At the time of this writing the cygwin1.dll included with the distrubution was problematic, if you encounter 
problems with cactid you will want to replace it with the latest snapshot available @ http://cygwin.com/snapshots/

The UNIX sources of NetSNMP and the MySQL

MySQL source files available @ www.mysql.com/downloads
Net-SNMP source files available @ www.netsnmp.org/download
